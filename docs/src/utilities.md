# Utility Functions

Flux contains some utility functions for working with data; these functions
help create inputs for your models or batch your dataset.
Other functions can be used to initialize your layers or to regularly execute
callback functions.

## Working with Data

```@docs
Flux.unsqueeze
Flux.stack
Flux.unstack
Flux.chunk
Flux.frequencies
Flux.batch
Flux.batchseq
Base.rpad(v::AbstractVector, n::Integer, p)
```

## Layer Initialization

These are primarily useful if you are planning to write your own layers.
Flux initializes convolutional layers and recurrent cells with `glorot_uniform`
by default.
To change the default on an applicable layer, pass the desired function with the
`init` keyword. For example:
```jldoctest; setup = :(using Flux)
julia> conv = Conv((3, 3), 1 => 8, relu; init=Flux.glorot_normal)
Conv((3, 3), 1=>8, relu)
```

```@docs
Flux.glorot_uniform
Flux.glorot_normal
Flux.orthogonal
```

## Model Abstraction

```@docs
Flux.destructure
```

## Callback Helpers

```@docs
Flux.throttle
Flux.stop
```
